// Qno10 Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each.
 //If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point,
 // just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
  //Then write one sentence describing what the program does.
